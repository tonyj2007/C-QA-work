fully bootstrapped email system including inbox, compose, delete email functionality. needs database data in order to run (on login screen username and password both = test and for compose test can also be used as the email addres your sending the mail to).
The ASP.NET based project utilises cookies and session objects in order to store much needed information between the web pages that would otherwise be lost due to the http connectionless connection type. The dataset information is accessed and stored using data table adapters.

This is quite a large application and dose not have comments yet
